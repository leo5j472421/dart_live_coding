// You are given a string of numbers between 0-9.
// Find the average of these numbers and return it as a floored whole number (ie: no decimal places) written out as a string.
// Eg: "zero nine five two" -> "four"
// Which mean the calculate will be : (0+9+5+2)/4 = 4, and 4 in string is four
// If the string is empty or includes a number greater than 9, return "n/a"
